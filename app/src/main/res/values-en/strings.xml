    <string name="gp_toys_info">Guinea pigs love to nibble, as they are rodents. Tree branches or other toys made of wood are usually to the liking of guinea pigs, because they can be chewed and offer a suitable challenge to wear down the teeth.  The natural instinct of rodents is to search for food by smelling and digging in the ground. Guinea pigs can be offered various puzzle games, for example you can hide a treat in a fluffy carpet, so the guinea pig can find it by sniffing and use its brain cells to get the treat. There are also puzzle balls intended for rodents, inside which you can put treats and the guinea pig can get them out by pushing it.</string>

    <string name="gp_kynnet_otsikko">Nail clipping</string>
    <string name="gp_kynnet_info">Guinea pigs\' nails can be cut either with nail scissors intended for rodents or with e.g. nail scissors for cats or small dogs. As a general rule, it would be good to cut your nails approximately every two weeks, however, the interval is individual. It can be affected, for example, by the age of the guinea pig, as nails grow more slowly in older guinea pigs. A blood vessel runs inside a guinea pig\'s claw, called a blood claw. You have to be careful when cutting the nails, because it is a sensitive spot and the guinea pig will get hurt if you accidentally cut the top of it. The best way is to cut the nails relatively often and a little at a time.</string>
    <string name="gp_asuminen_info">There are many cage options. There are cages for guinea pigs on the markets with a plastic bottom and a metal top. However, the cage can also be different - for example, built only on the floor from a metal frame and some kind of platform. The cage should have hiding places, stimulants, a drinking bottle, a hay rack, pellet cups, and littet boxes or a wood chip bedding. It can be difficult to put a wood chip bedding in the cage if it\'s not a regular one, so in that case you can place blankets on the floor as padding. Hiding places are, for example, nest huts, where guinea pigs can go to sleep or hide when "danger" threatens.</string>
    <string name="gp_asuminen_otsikko">Housing</string>
    <string name="gp_ruoka_info">The main diet of guinea pigs consists of hay, water and pellets. In addition, you can give guinea pigs fresh vegetables, such as lettuce, tomato, cucumber, paprika, parsley, etc. In addition to food, another vital condition for guinea pigs is the intake of vitamin C, because they cannot produce it themselves. Various vitamin C powders are sold on the market, and they are given to guinea pigs, for example, sprinkled on top of their cucumbers every day. Guinea pigs are herbivores, so anything of animal origin is dangerous for them.</string>

    <string name="dog_liikunta_info">Regular exercise is important for maintaining your dog\'s physical health, mental stimulation and preventing behavioral problems. The type and amount of exercise needed depends on the dog\'s age, breed and activity level. In general, most dogs need at least 30 minutes to one hour of exercise per day, but some breeds may require more. Exercise can be of many types, e.g. walking, running, fetching, swimming or hiking. Exercise not only helps dogs stay physically fit, but also promotes good behavior by reducing stress, anxiety and destruction of places. It is worth noting that the dog should not be exercised too vigorously, especially in hot or humid weather, as they are prone to heat stroke. Always make sure your dog has plenty of water and take frequent breaks during exercise.</string>
    <string name="dog_liikunta_otsikko">Exercise</string>
    <string name="dog_ruoka_info">Dogs are omnivores, which means they need a balanced diet that includes both animal and vegetable foods. Protein is important: Dogs need a quality source of protein in their diet to maintain muscle and healthy tissue. Good sources of protein for dogs are meat, fish, eggs and some vegetables. Carbohydrates are also important: Dogs need some carbohydrates in their diet for energy. Good sources of carbohydrates for dogs are grains, vegetables and fruits. Good sources of fat for dogs are animal fats, such as those found in meat and dairy products, and vegetable fats, such as fats from nuts and seeds. Dogs need various vitamins and minerals to maintain good health. These can come naturally through a balanced diet, but in some cases supplements may be necessary.</string>

    <string name="dog_turkki_otsikko">Grooming</string>
    <string name="dog_turkki_info">Regular grooming can help keep your dog\'s coat healthy and shiny, prevent matting, and reduce the risk of skin infections. This includes brushing the fur, cutting the nails, cleaning the ears, dental care and, if necessary, baths. Regular care of the fur and cleaning the ears are important, as they prevent skin infections. Use a dog-specific ear cleaner and avoid using cotton swabs. Depending on the breed and the length of the dogs fur, you may need to groom the fur every day, every few days, or once a week. Brushing removes dirt, dead hair and tangles from the fur. Use a brush suitable for your dogs coat type. When washing, use dog shampoo and rinse your dog thoroughly. Trimming your nails is important to prevent them from growing too long, as they cause health problems and discomfort.</string>
    <string name="dog_koulutus_otsikko">Training and Socialization</string>
    <string name="dog_koulutus_info">Training and socialization are essential for a happy dog. This includes basic good behaviour and providing opportunities for socialization. Puppies are more receptive to new experiences and learning between 3 and 14 weeks of age, so it is important to start training as soon as possible. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as treats, praise, and play to reward good behavior. Use the same commands and reward system every time so your dog knows what is expected of him. Take your dog to parks, puppy classes and other social situations. This helps the dog learn to interact with other dogs and people in a positive way. Be patient with your dog. Training and socialization take time, and each dog learns at its own pace. Dont get frustrated if the dog doesn\'t learn something right away.</string>

    <string name="cat_ruoka_info">Providing a balanced and nutritious diet is essential for a cat\'s overall health and well-being. Cats are carnivores, which is why they need food rich in animal protein. Fats are also important sources of energy, providing cats with essential fatty acids. Cats need certain vitamins and minerals in their diet to maintain health. These include the following vitamins: A, D, E, K, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium. Cats are natural grazers, so its best to feed them small meals throughout the day. Feeding 2–4 times a day is recommended for adult cats, and even more for kittens.</string>

    <string name="cat_liikunta_otsikko">Exercise</string>
    <string name="cat_liikunta_info">Cats need regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight, to prevent boredom and to promote overall wellness. Indoor cats may not have access to outdoor spaces, but they still need exercise. Playing with toys, climbing cat trees, and using puzzle feeders are great ways to keep indoor cats active. The type and amount of exercise a cat needs depends on their age, overall health and activity level. Older cats or cats with health problems may need less intense exercise. Cats are more likely to stick to an exercise routine if its fun and engaging.  Incorporating toys, treats and interactive play can make its exercise more enjoyable.</string>
    <string name="cat_turkki_otsikko">Grooming</string>
    <string name="cat_turkki_info">Regular grooming is important for the health of the cats fur, skin and general hygiene. This includes brushing, bathing, nail trimming and dental care. Brushing helps remove loose hair, prevents tangles and distributes natural oils throughout the coat. Long-haired cats should be brushed daily, while short-haired cats can be brushed once or twice a week. Most cats can groom themselves and don\'t need frequent baths, but if your cat is dirty or smelly, a bath may be necessary. Use a mild cat shampoo and rinse thoroughly. Trimming your cat\'s nails can prevent them from scratching the furniture. Use a special cat nail clipper and be careful not to cut the pink part inside the nail.</string>
    <string name="cat_ymparisto_otsikko">Environment</string>
    <string name="cat_ymparisto_info">Creating a safe environment for your cat is important - offer them a place to sleep, toys and play opportunities. Cats are curious and love to explore, so make sure their environment is safe and big enough. Keep dangerous objects out of reach of cats. Cats have an instinct for scratching, so it is good to offer cats something to scratch. This will also help prevent furniture from being scratched. Offering playtime and toys helps to keep the cat active and prevent boredom. Cats need a litter box that is easily accessible. Keep the cats\' environment at a comfortable temperature.</string>
